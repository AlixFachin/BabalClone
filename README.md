# Some fun with exploring 3JS

This project is a revisit of a game I used to play during physics class in high school on my HP48 calculator.
(The original is at <https://www.hpcalc.org/details/880>).

The idea is that you control a ball which bounces off a flat surface, and try not to fall into the holes in the terrain.
